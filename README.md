# AI Character Simulator üé≠

Welcome to the **AI Character Simulator** project, a powerful and interactive tool that allows you to engage in conversations with characters extracted from any text, such as books, stories, or documents! This project uses Streamlit for the frontend, Google's Gemini-Pro for AI-driven character generation, and ChromaDB for efficient conversation storage.

## üèó **Setup Instructions**

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.12+**  
2. **Streamlit**: Used for the web app interface.
3. **Google API Key**: For using Google's Gemini-Pro AI model.
4. **ChromaDB**: For persistent storage of conversation data.

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ofgeha-Gelana/EmoCharBot.git
    cd EmoCharBot
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
   - Add your **Google API Key** to the `.env` file:
     ```
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
     ```

5. **Run the app**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run dp.py
    ```

    This will start a local Streamlit app accessible at `http://localhost:8501`.

    - Choose one of the extracted characters from a list.
    - The character's description and traits will be displayed.

3. **Step 3: Start Chatting**
    - Begin chatting with the selected character. The AI will respond in the character's persona, taking into account their traits and role in the story.
    
4. **Step 4: View Conversation History**
    - Conversations with each character are stored and can be accessed later.
    - You can continue previous conversations or start new ones at any time.
